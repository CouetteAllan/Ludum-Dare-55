  PreEncounter: I found her too. She seems completely curled up on herself, trembling,
    and a moan escapes from her mouth. From her emanates an aura drowned by the stress
    and anxiety which completely invaded her, and transformed her into a ravaged
    and dangerous soul, for others but especially for herself.
  PostEncounter: 'Her stress, her thoughts and the gaze of a thousand people that
    invaded her fell on me. I heard her anxieties, her fears. I saw everyone pointing
    their accusing looks at me.  I understood the distress in which she was. She
    was drowned by this unstoppable wave of worries.

    I was able to invoke my
    faithful companions, and we helped her to overcome the anxiety that was overwhelming
    her and to reassure her fears. The work on herself remains important, but she
    is out of the woods.'
