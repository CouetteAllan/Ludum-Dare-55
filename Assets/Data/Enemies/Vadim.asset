  PreEncounter: "\tThis time, he found me. He came upon me, overcome by anger and
    devoured by hatred.\n\t Emanates an aggressive and violent aura from him, and
    all this negative energy has completely devoured him, transforming him into a
    violent and dangerous soul, for others and for himself."
  PostEncounter: "\tHis hatred and anger came to me in fury. They attacked relentlessly
    with all the insults and mockery that had invaded him, and I might have detected
    that all these criticisms and judgments were in fact the masks of his pain and
    fears.\n\t And then I understood how he had allowed himself to be devoured by
    hatred.\n\tI was able to summon my faithful companions, and we helped him ease
    his pain and reason his fears. The work on itself remains important, but it is
    a first step."
