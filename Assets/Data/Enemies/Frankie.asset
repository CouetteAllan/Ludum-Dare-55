  PreEncounter: "\tHe is there, in front of me. I found this damned soul, overwhelmed
    by shame and guilt. \n\t\n\tFrom him emanates an aggressive aura, which his self-punishments
    had transformed into a ravaged and dangerous soul, for others but especially
    for himself."
  PostEncounter: "\tHis fears and accusations fell on me and I understood the distress
    in which he was. I heard the remarks he had experienced, I saw the shame of his
    mistakes and his decisions.\n\t He had been devoured by this feeling of having
    caused misfortune to the world.I was able to invoke my faithful companions, and
    we helped him to overcome and calm this shame which invaded him. \n\t\n\tThe
    work on himself remains important, but he is out of the woods."
